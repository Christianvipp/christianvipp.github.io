Visiting the webpage shows a portfolio:\nI fuzzed for hidden directories and found a few: /assets, /images, /css, /js. Visiting /assets, there were more directories. Going to /fonts/blog, there was a strange redirection and a change in the hostname:\nIt looks like a WordPress site, so I added the hostname to my hosts file:\nA quick look at Wappalyzer showed that it\u0026rsquo;s running an old version of WordPress:\nScanning with WPScan: I used WPScan to scan the site. WPScan is a powerful CMS scanner specifically for WordPress, with features like user enumeration, plugin detection, and theme detection.\nRunning an aggressive plugin detection scan revealed a vulnerable plugin:\nGaining Access/Foothold: After a quick Google search, I discovered the plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. It has a public exploit and a Metasploit module, but the Metasploit exploit didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me:\nI decided to exploit it manually.\nOn a blog post, there\u0026rsquo;s an option to make a comment with an image upload functionality:\nTrying to upload any file other than an image throws an error:\nAfter several attempts, I was able to bypass the filter using file headers. The server checks files via mechanisms like file extensions and MIME types, but I was able to trick it by injecting a GIF file type header into a reverse shell script from PentestMonkey:\nI filled out the other form fields and submitted the comment:\nMeanwhile, I set up a netcat listener, and once the comment was posted, I received a reverse shell:\nWe now have a shell as www-data. Let\u0026rsquo;s find some flags. I navigated to the user james and found the first flag:\nPrivilege Escalation: Attempting to access other users gave a \u0026ldquo;Permission denied\u0026rdquo; error, so it\u0026rsquo;s time for privilege escalation.\nAfter some enumeration, I found that the user vagrant is also present.\nI continued manual enumeration and discovered that I could escalate privileges to vagrant since this user has permissions to run all commands without a password:\nFinally, I gained root access and captured the flag!\nGreat box.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:33599/portfolio/blogger/","summary":"Platform: Proving Grounds\nLevel: Easy\nRecon: A rustscan as usual!\nTwo open ports 22 and 80, by default, we know that is SSH and HTTP.\nScanning: Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and scan those ports to know which services run on them and their versions.\nSSH and HTTP with their respective versions, and we can deduce the OS is Linux.\nEnumeration: I ran a curl command to the webserver, hoping to get some information from the headers.","title":"Blogger"},{"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:33599/portfolio/hub/","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"About Me\nIntroduction Hello!
