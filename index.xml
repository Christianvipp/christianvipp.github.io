Level: Easy
Recon: A rustscan as usual!
Two open ports 22 and 80, by default, we know that is SSH and HTTP.
Scanning: Let&amp;rsquo;s go ahead and scan those ports to know which services run on them and their versions.
SSH and HTTP with their respective versions, and we can deduce the OS is Linux.
Enumeration: I ran a curl command to the webserver, hoping to get some information from the headers.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://christianvipp.org/portfolio/hub/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christianvipp.org/portfolio/hub/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://christianvipp.org/whoami/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christianvipp.org/whoami/</guid><description>About Me
Introduction Hello! My name is Olatunbosun Ayodeji Victor. I&amp;rsquo;m a 19-year-old network and web penetration tester with a deep passion for cybersecurity. My journey into this field began four years ago, and it has been an exciting and challenging adventure ever since.
Education I started my cybersecurity journey by learning the fundamentals from platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and YouTube. I owe much of my knowledge to top educators such as IPPSEC, John Hammond, HackerSploit, and Cryptcat.</description></item></channel></rss>
