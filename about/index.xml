Introduction Hello! My name is Olatunbosun Ayodeji Victor. I&amp;rsquo;m a 19-year-old network and web penetration tester with a deep passion for cybersecurity. My journey into this field began four years ago, and it has been an exciting and challenging adventure ever since.
Education I started my cybersecurity journey by learning the fundamentals from platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and YouTube. I owe much of my knowledge to top educators such as IPPSEC, John Hammond, HackerSploit, and Cryptcat.</description></item></channel></rss>
