**About Me**

Hey there! 👋 I’m Christian Victor, a 19-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast from Nigeria, currently living in Łódź, Poland. Right now, I’m officially a management student at AHE University—because who doesn’t need to manage something? But let’s be real, my heart is all about the thrill of cybersecurity.

**My Journey Into Hacking**

The love for hacking? It started young. I was the kid who set up the family WiFi… and then tried to hack it. (Nothing says “fun Saturday” like almost locking everyone out of the internet, right?) My curiosity quickly turned into a passion for breaking things to understand how they work, and eventually, that became a career path in cybersecurity, specifically Red Teaming. Why Red Teaming? Because blue is a great color, but nothing beats the excitement of almost getting caught.

**Skills & Interests (Yes, I Actually Have Those)**

I've been hitting the books and the virtual hacking grounds to build my skills:

**Capture the Flags (CTFs)**: I’m an avid CTF player, and let’s just say I have a knack for landing in the top 10%. Apparently, my brain just likes puzzles… or I just don’t know when to quit.


**Platforms Conquered**: Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Proving Grounds, Pentester Labs—you name it, I’ve probably logged some intense hours there. Think of it as gaming, but with more code and less respawn.

**Technical Know-How**: Networking, web and wireless security, Linux admin, and even a bit of cloud security. Add Active Directory, and we’re looking at a pretty solid cyber toolbelt.


**Security Frameworks**: I’m well-versed in frameworks like OWASP Top 10, Microsoft SDL, MITRE ATT&CK, and the SANS Top 25. Because who doesn’t love reading a good list of vulnerabilities over breakfast?

**Content & Community**

I’m not just in it for the code—I love sharing what I know! I’ve started creating content, including cheat sheets, tips, methodologies, and maybe some YouTube tutorials. Who knows, you might catch me on a screen near you explaining the “magic” behind brute-force attacks or why certain exploits are chef’s kiss beautiful.

**Future Goals**

First up: getting my bachelor’s in management, because it sounds fancy and hey, might come in handy. After that, I’m aiming for an internship at a top cybersecurity firm and then a master’s in cybersecurity. The ultimate goal? To mix business savvy with tech skills and help companies up their security game, ideally with fewer PowerPoint slides and more hands-on action.
