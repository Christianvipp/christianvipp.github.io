## Platform : Proving Grounds  
**Level**: Easy

### Reconnaissance:

A rustscan as usual to find open ports, 22 and 80 opened.

### Scanning:

Performed an nmap scan to find version information on the open ports and operating system identification using the aggressive nmap flag.

An Apache webserver is hosted on port 80, and SSH is running on port 22 as usual.

A quick visit to the website shows a default Apache webserver page.

I fuzzed for hidden directories and found a secret directory, which contained a file called `evil.php`.

Visiting the secret directory had no content, and `evil.php` was also empty, but it seemed like a good candidate for fuzzing. I initially thought of using `wfuzz`, but had issues installing it due to time constraints. So I used BurpSuite's intruder tool, which allowed me to fuzz two parameters using the "clustering bomb" payload.

After starting the attack and analyzing the results, I noticed a difference in response length. It was a hit! The first parameter was vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).

I was able to view the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Exploitation:

I initially thought of trying SSH log poisoning or brute-forcing SSH, but neither worked. However, I was able to read the `id_rsa` file of the user `mowree` and copied it to my attacker machine.

Unfortunately, the `id_rsa` file was passphrase-protected. To crack the passphrase, I used `ssh2john` to convert the RSA file into a hash that John the Ripper could process.

After running John the Ripper, I successfully cracked the passphrase.

I was then able to connect to the target via SSH.

Once inside, I found the first flag in the user's directory.

### Privilege Escalation:

As time was limited, I transferred the `linpeas` script to the target for automated enumeration. Upon reviewing the results, I noticed that the `passwd` file was writableâ€”indicating a serious misconfiguration.  
I followed a guide on how to exploit a writable `passwd` file, generated a new password using `openssl`, and added it to the file to create a fake root user.

Switching to the new root user worked, and I successfully got the root flag.

### Conclusion:

Got the root flag, and that's it. Thank you, hackers! Until next time, stay burped!

**Vulnerabilities used**: LFI, writable `passwd` file.
